This is a website built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and TailwindCSS for the front-end.
Solidity is also used to work on the ethereum blockchain, as well as the smart contract is deployed on Polygon-Mumbai Network.

## Getting Started

The website is deployed on this link [DataFort](https://data-fort.vercel.app/). 

First it will prompt the user to connect their metamask wallet(s). 

The website is designed such that the wallet connected will change when the metamask wallet is changed for ease.

The user has to select the image they want to upload and upload it. 

Pinata is used to work with the IPFS protocols and upload the image on the ethereum blockchain. 

A metamask window will open up to confirm the transaction and pay the fees in matic.

After confirming the transaction, a user can get their own data or data from someone else using their wallet address. 

If the user doesn't enter any address in the input, then the user's data/image(s) will be displayed. 

At the bottom is the share button, where a user can add addresses to share with and revoke the access permission with a particular address. 

For sharing data with a particular address or revoking address from one, it will take some fees again to make changes on the blockchain network.
